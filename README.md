## Disclosure
All of the findings in this repository have been **fully** clean room reverse engineered using decompilation, official public documentation, and educated guesses. Neither myself nor my employer have any contacts at Microsoft that have provided source code. Any software that I have used or will use for this project is legally obtained and fully legitimate. Reverse engineering of computer software is legal in the United States according to Section 103(f) of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act.

## Goals
My main goal with this project is to document Dexterity's inner workings so that a modern alternative to the existing Dexterity suite can be created. Currently as of September 2021, the only way to use Dexterity is to use the aging editor provided by Microsoft. It is quite old and is very frustrating to use. 

Ideally I would like to create a plugin for Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code that includes the full capabilities of the existing editor. Also, I feel that there is a strong lack of documentation about Dexterity, especially the behind-the-scenes parts.
